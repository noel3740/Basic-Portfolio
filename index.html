                I'm Noel Nevarez. A web developer who loves to travel, cook and eat different food. I'm originally from Slidell Louisiana. 
                I'm not a big fan of the heat and with humidity frequently around 100%, Louisiana was not an ideal place for a person who doesn't like heat. 
                I always wanted to live up north in a place that actually had seasons. I took a vacation to Chicago in 2007 and fell in love with the people and big city life.
                I decided I wanted to live in Chicago and months later I was living in the city.
